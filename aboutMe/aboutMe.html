    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <!--Should be centered-->
        <p>My name is Cameron Hunter. This is my second semester as a senior at CSUSB. This page is an introduction to me.</p>
    <h2>My Time at CSUSB</h2>
        <p>Like I mentioned above, this year is my senior year here at CSUSB. My major is Computer Science. While most of my time at CSUSB has been spent in the Computer Science
            program, I do also have some experience in other fields. In my freshman year, I took a few semester of Japanese and more recently, I have ventured into GIS starting 
            last semester and continuing this semester. GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems, and focuses on using computers to make and manipulate maps.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <h3>Games</h3>
            <!--Needs more-->
           <p>I have been playing video games for almost as long as I can remember and they have been a very large part of my life. ...</p>

           <p>I have also been collecting Pokemon cards for a long time. In highschool, I reintroduced a passion for the Pokemon TCG to my friends and we went to several Pokemon 
            set prereleases together. This rediscovery of trading card games lead me to Magic: The Gathering, which is my current favorite card game to play. However, Pokemon is 
            still my favorite TCG to collect.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>I really love listening to music and I am constantly looking for new music. I have a pretty small collection of vinyl records of some of my favorite albums as well. 
                Quite recently, I bought an electric bass and I have been trying to teach myself to play, though it is very slow going. My eventual goal is to also learn to play 
                guitar, but I can't in good conscience buy myself a guitar and all the related equipment before I even learn to play my bass.</p>

        <h3>Movies</h3>
            <p>Going to the movie theater and watching a good movie is one of my favorite things to do on a day off. Over time, I've come to appreciate the kind of films that come 
                from smaller directors and especially the kind of films that come out of a small budget. One of my favorite movies is Evil Dead II, and by extension The Evil Dead 
                and Army of Darkness because they really make the most of their small budgets in a way that is really fun to watch.</p>

        <h3>Books</h3>
            <!--Needs more-->
            <p>I have loved reading ever since I was a child and that love continues to today. Most of my recent reading has been in the form of manga and other comics, though I 
                have been trying to read more novels. ...</p>

        <h3>Outdoors</h3>
            <p>...</p>
